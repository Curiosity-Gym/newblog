A few weeks back we launched an Innovation Hub at Cathedral Middle School, Mumbai. It has truly been the most rewarding of  experiences of my working life.

To see the kids faces glow as they either &#8211; learn to 3D doodle their butterflies, roses, spectacles, spiders  &#8211; or design their own bangles and buildings to live on in Mars,  &#8211; or go gaga as the 3D printers hum at the back of the room &#8211; or fight over the latest brain teaser at lunch time &#8211; or read their creative slogans and poems &#8211; or test their instructors on whether they remember their name &#8211; or &#8230; need I say more?

I truly believe that this is just the beginning.

The next generation of great inventors are younger than us by a few decades. At the Hub we aspire to give them a platform to recognise and unleash their creativity and blossom into the inventors of tomorrow. By asking the question &#8216;Why?&#8217; &#8211; and imagining the next question.
