<div>
  Yesterday, a couple of my ex-s and I got together to build a &#8230; something for Rupin at Curiosity Gym. This is a new space coming up in town, Ballard Estate to be exact and I guess would cater well to the south of Mumbai.

  Anyhow, the woodworking get-together was a kind of a first for me since I would be instructing using power tools. If you know me at all, you&#8217;ll know that I consider power tools to be a necessary evil. But I also accept that one can sort of marry the hand tool love with the power tool speed and get an experience altogether unique.

If you cant fathom how, come for a class.

**The meeting**

Now Asma, Vibhav, Rupin and I met at about 1:30, in the lovely ACed room of the &#8220;gym&#8221;. Rupin had about 3 things he wished to be built for the space, one of which, due to him being vertically challenged, was a stool. (nudge nudge)

  We chose this as a project doable in 4 hours.
</div>

A stool a a fairly uncomplicated, but challenging project. 4 legs to be attached perfectly to a flat top.

<div>
  <strong>Challenges</strong>
</div>

  1. The stool must not rock. All 4 legs have to be perfectly angled and of the same length.
  2. Worse is the forces acting on the stool. Straight down is simple, the legs will hold that. The trouble is when the person bends over slightly. This is when the shear force takes over. Shear is a carpenter&#8217;s worst nightmare, if not done right, the legs simply break at the joint, leaving Rupin with a bloody nose.

Now we happen to like Rupin, so the design was tweaked to a &#8220;pati&#8221; style design with additional braces for the legs.

This meant 5 pieces of wood to be cut up.We were using second hand wood, and additionally we didn&#8217;t have a long enough straight edge.Â Regardless, after a quick, but stern session on safety we plugged in the saw. This beast is a 1500W Skil circular saw with a 2mm kerf and a 6 inch blade. When it roared to life the excitement was palpable.

**Getting going**

I believe Vibhav went first; according to Asma, its gents first when using dangerous power tools. hahahaha.

<div>
  Not surprisingly both of them got their first ever cut down pat. Both hands safely on the tool, balance perfect and above all perfect patience. It was sheer poetry .

<div>
  We used all the power tools that CG had to offer. The circular saw to get those long straight cuts, then the jig saw for hmm &#8220;fun&#8221;, and finally the drill.

</div>

I then gave my standard spiel about screwing. (Ok stop giggling!) followed by a bit of joinery and we put together the stool.

We finished up the day with Rupin standing atop the &#8220;pedestal&#8221;; it was perfect. No wobble, no sway and as steady as a rock.

All in all a great day spent with a lovely set of people sharing my love and passion for woodworking.

  The world is a good and exciting place.
